# Old School Skin
By Dj.Anth0n1

This is a very basic skin with 2 turntables and a 2 channel mixer.The resolusion is 1024x768 and the skin is not resizable.Trying to simulate the “feel” as close as possible,the skin is just for simple mixing-beatmatching without effects and samplers, like the “old days”. So, if you are interested in effects,waveforms,samplers e.tc. and all the modern stuff then this skin is not for you because non of the above supported by this skin.
